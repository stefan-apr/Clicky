# Clicky

This application is a simple memory-based browser clicking game with a Pokemon theme. It is developed in Javascript using React.

The objective is simple: The user engages with the game by clicking on Pokemon tiles. After a tile is picked, the tiles are shuffled into a random order. The user must try to pick every single tile without selecting any duplicates to win, and so must commit the picked tiles to memory. Whether they succeed or fail, they can begin a new game by picking a fresh tile when prompted by the victory/game over message.

//TO DO\\
Add support for the user to choose a difficulty by picking the number of tiles they want at game start.
Add the easter egg I have in mind
